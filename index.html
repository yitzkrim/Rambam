    <h3>In his commentary on the Mishnah (Sanhedrin, chapter 10),
      <br> Maimonides formulates his <strong>"13 principles of faith".</strong>
      <br>They summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of Judaism: </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> The existence of God.
      <li> God's unity and indivisibility into elements.
      <li> God's spirituality and incorporeality.
      <li> God's eternity.
      <li> God alone should be the object of worship.
      <li> Revelation through God's prophets.
      <li> The preeminence of Moses among the prophets.
      <li> That the entire Torah (both the Written and Oral law) are of Divine origin and were dictated to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai.
      <li> The Torah given by Moses is permanent and will not be replaced or changed.
      <li> God's awareness of all human actions and thoughts.
      <li> Reward of righteousness and punishment of evil.
      <li> The coming of the Jewish Messiah.
      <li> The resurrection of the dead.
    </ol>

    Maimonides compiled the principles from various Talmudic sources. These principles were controversial when first proposed, evoking criticism by Rabbis Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo, and were effectively ignored by much of the Jewish community
    for the next few centuries.[48] However, these principles have become widely held and are considered to be the cardinal principals of faith for Orthodox Jews.[49][50] Two poetic restatements of these principles (Ani Ma'amin and Yigdal) eventually
    became canonized in many editions of the "Siddur" (Jewish prayer book).
